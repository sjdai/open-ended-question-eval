"I found this Course less well prepared than the previous 3 modules . Misleading hints in the assignments , code errors , etc . . . Also , I found the amount of work required higher , which is not in itself a bad thing , just a bit unexpected ."
not bad . . . theres a big mistake in the regex video . assignments don ' t really match the lectures . Without Corey Schafer and Sentdex on youtube I would ' ve quit .

I am an engineer and I use matlab and stata for data analysis and currently taking Machine Learning course by Stanford which is fabulous . I did not like this course for the following reasons : 1 - bad course design structure2 - so confusing and inappropriate sequence
"Lectures are brief , shallow and too compressedGrader is buggyGenerally course is bad . I spent more time in Stackoverflow than here to find answers"
"Very good course , with good difficulty , tools and materialsBut there is some problems with assestments as old autograder ' s version and bad formulating of tasks , but instructors in forums are great ( responded me in a hour or less ) I hightly recommend this course"
"The course is not bad for the start , but I ' m a little bit confused because of difference between lectures and assignments ' tasks ."
"Interesting assignments but definitely not the best video lectures - very short and not enough explanation , can as well read a documentation on my own . Overall is not a bad course , but either change the name from ' Introduction ' to ' Intermediate ' - ish or create a more comprehensive set of lectures . Thanks !"
The course itself is not so bad . But tasks are frustrating ! Solving them gives some value but they are mixed with tons of meaningless problems . Some tasks are not clear and autograder gives little information . But I need to say that I learnt more about Python and Pandas library .
Quite bad knowledge delivery from lectures . The course is rather self learning than course . A lot of vague points and uncertainties in assignments .
"Lessons were ok but the assignments were really frustrating , not because of the questions itself but because the questions were organised badly or were really vague and confusing ."
Not a bad course if the student is brand new to data science / computer science / programming . I felt I could have easiliy skipped this excepting that accounts needed to be set out for other course dependencies .
"While the course offers a good introduction to open source tools , this course and the whole specialization track is available for free on cognitive class . . And the badge issued by cognitive class doesn ' t say powered by coursera . So 2 stars for charging money for a free course"
"A very bad course ! ! ! Extremely disappointed by this course . It was meant to be for beginners , but the explanation was not understandable for beginners . Even the videos were very short and didn ' t explain some of the very basic parts . Worst experience I every had with any of the coursera courses ."
"Really bad and useless course . At this point I know nothing about data ( it ' s only the 2nd course in the specialization ) , so how can I understand anything about the tools and their advantages , given I still don ' t know what the challenges are ?"
